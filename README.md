# Shoping Cart Implementation using React and RTK(Redux ToolKit)

> The Actual project helps to understand how redux resolves the props drilling issue by providing a way to have
only one source of truth, a store, in which we have all of our states to manage them in a predictable and safe manner.

> A Shoping Cart helps to keep track of all the operations that a user does on the platform such as :
- getting detailed information on a product
 - selecting products that he/she want to order
 - having control on what he/she can pay since we have an option where where a user can remove completly the item from
 the cart of reduce the quantity before making any orders
 - etc.
